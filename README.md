<h2>E-Challan </h2>

By Team Aavishkarak
Smart India Hackathon

**Aim:** To make the payment of the fine generated during any accident online using an app and also to store all the data generated during the accident and all the details related to that accident in the database, which helps easy retrieval and searching of data.   


The App will be there with the police officer who wants to file the complaint and register this incident. The app will store the details of the incident like the name of the officer, name of the charged person, Date, Vehicle no, License No. and the fine charged. The user will recieve a Notification with the payment link for the challan on the mobile number registered with the License. If the person tries to run away, the police officer just needs to note down the License number to send the E-challan directly to the user.
Also we have interesting features for the officers which makes the app much better to use and engaging.
